# LearnLowerBody

Research for lower body generation using imitation learning using PPO. This repository made use of Unity ML-Agents to create reinforcement learning environment for lower body locomotion generation that follows kinematic motion. This repository reproduced results of two papers which are mentioned at the reference part.

This repository contains code for reproducing the papers [DeepMimic: Example Guided Deep Reinforceme nt Learning of Physics Based Character Skills Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02717) in Unity Engine. To deal with the longer length ((≈90 sec, ≈5 sec for DeepMimic) and diverse categories of reference motion clips, we adopted the two step method of motion generator and tracking controller, introduced in [Learning predict and simulate policies from unorganized human motion data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3355089.3356501).
